Analyze GitHub issue(s): $ARGUMENTS

For each issue:

1. Add the `inprogress` label to the issue via GitHub CLI and assign the issue to the local `gh` user before analysis starts. If the `inprogress` label does not exist in the repository, create it via GitHub CLI first (for example: `gh label create inprogress --color F9D0C4 --description "Work in progress"`) and then apply it. If label creation, label assignment, or user assignment fails, report that explicitly and continue.
2. Read the issue in full, including all comments and linked issues/PRs. Use fields supported by GitHub CLI, for example:
   ```sh
   gh issue view <issue> --json title,body,comments,labels,assignees,state,url,author,createdAt,updatedAt,closedByPullRequestsReferences
   ```
3. Do not trust analysis written in the issue. Independently verify behavior and derive your own analysis from the code and execution path.

4. **For bugs**:
   - Ignore any root cause analysis in the issue (likely wrong)
   - Read all related code files in full (no truncation)
   - Trace the code path and identify the actual root cause
   - Propose a fix

5. **For feature requests**:
   - Do not trust implementation proposals in the issue without verification
   - Read all related code files in full (no truncation)
   - Propose the most concise implementation approach
   - List affected files and changes needed

Do NOT implement unless explicitly asked. Analyze and propose only.

If implementation is explicitly requested after the analysis:
- If available, use the `xp` skill to guide the implementation with small, validated increments.
- If it would improve context-window usage or parallel investigation, use the `tmux-pilot` skill to delegate focused work to another Pi instance via tmux.
