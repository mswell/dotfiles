# Learnings - JS Code Analysis Install Script

- Followed the template from `setup/Skills/security-audit/install.sh`.
- Adapted the script for JavaScript-specific dependencies (Node.js) and tools (ast-grep).
- Included a comprehensive list of required files for verification, covering references, patterns, scripts, and test fixtures.
- Removed unnecessary comments from the script to comply with "agent memo" and "unnecessary comment" rules, while keeping essential usage information.
- Verified that the script correctly handles help output and identifies default installation paths.
